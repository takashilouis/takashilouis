Hi there, I'm Khanh Nguyen 👋

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer transitioning from an extensive background in Embedded Systems Engineering. With over 6 years of experience in embedded software, I’m now focused on broadening my expertise in Software Engineering and DevOps, particularly in full-stack development and cloud-based technologies. Currently, I’m pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Dakota State University. 

🌱 I’m gradually converting from Embedded Software Engineering to Software Engineering, working on backend and cloud projects.<br/>
⚙️ I’m building and managing scalable cloud infrastructures using AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.<br/>
🔭 I’m working on a full-stack Airbnb clone project using Angular, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.<br/>
